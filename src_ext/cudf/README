libCUDF - CUDF (Common Upgradeability Description Format) library
=================================================================

libCUDF is a library to manipulate so called CUDF documents. A CUDF
(Common Upgradeability Description Format) document describes an
"upgrade scenario", as faced by package managers in popular
package-based FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) distributions.

A CUDF document consists of an optional leading "preamble", a "package
universe", and a trailing "user request":

- The package universe describes all packages known to the package
  manager, a subset of which (the "package status") denotes the
  package being currently installed on a given machine.

- The user request denotes a change to the package status requested by
  the user, e.g.: "install package foo", "remove package bar", ...

- The preamble contains meta-information such as a typing information
  for custom package properties, checksums, document unique
  identifiers, ...

A CUDF document is naturally complemented by a "solution" describing
the resulting package status (if any) that satisfies the user request,
as found by a package manager.

libCUDF enables manipulation of CUDF and related documents.
